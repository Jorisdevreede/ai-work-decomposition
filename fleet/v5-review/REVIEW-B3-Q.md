# Batch 3 second review (Q, pane 5, Opus 5.5)

**Running verdict after round 1 (16 Oct 11:23): 7 files read, 6 fix, 1 good, 0 redo.** Too early to rank models:
different jobs, two or three files each.

| Model | Files read | Fix | Good | Redo |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| opus-5.5 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| sol-6.1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| grok-4.7 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |

Open defect classes (round 1):
- **All models:** a machine/0% step relies on a structured input that no step or contract produces, or whose
  capture effort is not counted (sold-out flags, discrepancy codes, par levels, structured addresses).
- **Grok:** in-person steps the design does not touch (listening, telling, taking payment, noticing) lose 15-45%.
- **Opus:** steps go to machine 0% while the design keeps a scan, a code pick or hand pricing in them;
  already-counted entries name unchanged core work instead of the review or exception time the design adds.
- **Sol:** graphs are short (2.8 steps per task) and mostly sound; the one fix is uncounted discrepancy capture.

**R/Q disagreements:** none yet. R has no verdicts at 11:23.

## Method

- Every ~2 hours: two new passed files each from `opus-5.5` and `sol-6.1`, plus four `grok-4.7` files (one per
  Grok pane G1-G4 by claim owner, topped up at random if a pane has none). Seeded `random.Random(seed)` over the
  unreviewed passed files in manifest order; the seed is recorded per round. Files R or Q already read can be
  picked again: a file read by both is the R/Q comparison.
- Each file is read task by task against the O*NET statement in its prompt and the defect list in the prompt
  header (order, savings, labels, evidence, already-counted/ranges). Verdicts: **good** usable as a provisional
  design; **fix** one or more defects that change a step, a gate or a saving; **redo** templated or not about the
  task.
- The finalize checks are rerun read-only on each sampled file (no file written). A structural scan runs over all
  passed files of every label each round: repeated step text, numerical shapes, inputs consumed before they are
  produced, approvals after their action or before the artefact they gate, approval cycles, shared ids reused
  inside a task, digest claims cited as model knowledge, legal claims under capability/case.
- Q never edits answers. Patterns that repeat go to `fleet/STATUS.md` as `<time> Q ALERT <label>: <pattern> <file>`.

## Rounds

### Round 1 — selected 11:16-11:18 CEST, written 11:23

Gate: the background wait fired at 11:16. It also counted one answer written but not yet finalized (Grok
`41-2011.00__4`, no `_meta`), so the helper now counts only files with finalizer metadata and an empty checks
list. The sample was redrawn with the same seed `batch3-Q-round1-20261016` on that population: 12 finalized
passes (grok 3, opus 3, sol 6). Selected: opus `53-7065.00__3`, `35-3031.00__2`; sol `53-7065.00__4`,
`35-3031.00__3`; Grok `41-2011.00__2` (G2), `37-2011.00__1` (G4), `41-2011.00__6` (G4). G1 and G3 had no
finalized pass, so one Grok slot is pending. All seven pass the finalize checks rerun read-only with the 11:11
tool fix. 26 task statements were checked.

Structural scan at 11:22 over all 21 passes (grok 6/22 tasks, opus 5/20, sol 10/33): no repeated step sequence in
any label; full numerical shapes unique except sol (31/33 economic shapes, largest coarse group 4); one sol step
text repeats across two tasks of the same job ("clarify patrons food and beverage choices"), which is a shared
step rather than a template. Shape: Grok 4.8 steps per task, Opus 6.2, Sol 2.8. Sol has four zero-saving tasks,
which are correct for conversation-only work.

Targeted structural finding (outside the random sample): **Grok `41-2011.00__4` (G1) `:2416` a1 is an approval
cycle.** s5 "enter the count" is gated by a1, approved at s6 "witness the count", and s6 consumes s5's
`deposit count`. This is the batch-2 Terra cycle class. Gate the release that uses the witnessed count, not the
entry that the witness reads. Opus `35-3023.00__1:23100/s3` (machine, act_external, no gate) is a false positive:
the linked terminal passes the amount and the customer authorises the payment.

Tool note: until 11:11 the finalizer rejected every valid bulleted `- [S#]` citation. The three sol files
finalized before then (`41-2011.00__1`, `53-7065.00__1`, `53-7065.00__2`) cite only model knowledge. That may
reflect the tool rather than the worker; treat their evidence as unproven rather than as a provenance defect.
The 37-2 group has no digest (`research/digests-minor/37-2.md` is absent), so E1 model knowledge is the only valid
source for janitor prompts.

Findings per file:

- **opus `53-7065.00__3` (fix).** `:23896` markdown pricing: s2 lookup goes to machine 0% while the design
  still has the stocker scan each item and pick a days-to-expiry or condition code; s3 calculation goes to 0%
  although loose goods and one-off prices stay manual and multi-buy/group prices (in the statement) are not in
  the design. Keep a share for capture and manual pricing. `:23891` vendor return: no step receives the vendor's
  acceptance or return authorisation before packing. `:23882/s4` cuts 15% for a terminal re-keying the step text
  never states. Already-counted entries name unchanged steps. Strengths: approval binds the exact s3 version
  before the external send; legal sources [S3]/[S4] match the digest.
- **opus `35-3031.00__2` (fix).** `:2283/s6` and `:2284/s6` use a `sold-out list` no step or contract produces;
  the machine 0% depends on kitchen flags whose capture is not counted. Already-counted entries point at
  unchanged recommendation and telling steps (35h, 50h) instead of the residual lookup and returns. `:18746`
  cites [S2] (QR ordering at the table) for online takeaway ordering, which it does not show. Strengths:
  allergen view is deterministic with an "ask the chef" fallback; guest conversation stays at 100%.
- **sol `53-7065.00__4` (fix).** `:23871/s2` generates complete receipts with discrepancy details at machine 0%,
  but partial and damage codes need capture at handover that no step counts; the s3 check compares the receipt
  with the record it was generated from, so it proves the mapping, not the handover. Customer signature has no
  step. `:23895` is sound (version-bound, no double saving).
- **sol `35-3031.00__3` (good).** `:18748` local directions is one honest manual step at 0%. `:2294` wine
  advice keeps both conversation steps at 100% and saves only on the list lookup, with named producers for
  descriptions, prices and stock, and counted upkeep. Minor: the range basis words "high" as a bigger-saving case.
- **Grok `41-2011.00__2` (G2, fix).** `:2408` cuts listening (s1 85%), telling (s6 65%, s7 80%) and walking
  the exception to the supervisor (s4 55%) although only the s2 lookup changes; s3 routes "standard vs
  exception" by machine although that is the cashier's judgement. `:2419/s1` and s5 cut noticing and waiting
  with no mechanism. `:2405/s1` saves 40% of scanning by moving it to a self-scan lane "the store already runs",
  which is today's baseline. Strengths: the s2 loop is well bounded and its check tests meaning; both approvals
  bind the exact artefact; [S#] claims match the digest.
- **Grok `37-2011.00__1` (G4, fix).** `:9544/s3` and `:20590/s3` mark forms the janitor writes as
  person_reviews to claim 60% cuts; no machine drafts anything. `:9545` consumes `par levels` that do not exist
  today and have no producer; its today means (system screen) contradicts the handwritten list in the blocker;
  the requisition approval has no void-on-edit although the supervisor "always cuts quantities". Strengths: the
  walk, locking and cupboard count stay at 100%; E1 entries say plainly that the job has no digest.
- **Grok `41-2011.00__6` (G4, fix).** `:2413/s4` cuts payment by 25% while the design says the cashier still
  takes card or cash. `:2424/s2` invents a "re-read the transaction for a bulky flag" step today that the blocker
  says does not exist; it carries the task's whole saving. `:2409/s5` cuts paper filing ~60% with no mechanism.
  Catalogue and bulky-marker upkeep is labelled focal although the retail lead does it. `:2415` uses a
  structured address with no counted capture. Strengths: both gates bind exact artefacts; the `:2409` reading
  loop is bounded with one attempt.

Next round about 13:23.
